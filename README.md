# Student Management System - README

## Overview
The **Student Management System** is a simple console-based application implemented in **C** to manage student records. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding, deleting, modifying, searching, and displaying student records. The records are stored in a text file named `studentManagement.txt`.

The application supports the following functionalities:
1. **Add a Student**: Add a new student with a unique ID and details (Name, Batch Code, Class, Faculty).
2. **Delete a Student**: Delete a student record using their batch code.
3. **Modify a Student**: Modify the details of an existing student by their batch code.
4. **Show Students**: Display a list of all students stored in the system.
5. **Search for a Student**: Search for a student based on their batch code.
6. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Features
- **Batch Code Validation**: Ensures that the batch code follows the correct format: `XXXX-123` (4 letters followed by a hyphen and 3 digits).
- **Dynamic ID Generation**: Automatically generates a unique student ID when adding a new student.
- **Color-coded Messages**: Success, error, and informational messages are displayed in color for better user experience.
- **File-Based Storage**: All student records are stored in `studentManagement.txt` and are persisted between program runs.

## Compilation and Execution

### Requirements:
- C Compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Operating System that supports C development.

### Steps to Compile and Run:
1. **Save the code** to a file named `student_management.c`.
2. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   gcc -o student_management student_management.c
Run the program:
bash
Copy
./student_management
Functions Overview
addStudent()
This function adds a new student record:

Generates a unique student ID.
Prompts for and stores the student's name, batch code, class, and faculty.
Appends the new record to studentManagement.txt.
deleteStudent()
Deletes a student record based on the batch code:

The program searches for the student by their batch code.
If found, the student is deleted from the file and the updated data is saved in studentManagement.txt.
modifyStudent()
Modifies an existing student's details based on their batch code:

Searches for the student by batch code.
Prompts the user to enter new details (name, batch code, class, faculty).
Updates the record and saves it to studentManagement.txt.
showStudents()
Displays a list of all students stored in the system:

Retrieves all student records from studentManagement.txt.
Displays the student data in a formatted table with columns for ID, Name, Batch Code, Class, and Faculty.
searchStudent()
Searches for a student by their batch code:

Prompts the user to enter the batch code.
Searches the file for a student with the matching batch code.
If found, displays the student's details.
clearInputBuffer()
Clears any leftover characters from the input buffer to prevent input issues during subsequent user inputs.

generateID()
Generates a unique student ID:

Reads existing records from studentManagement.txt.
Finds the highest ID and increments it to generate the next available ID.
isValidBatchCode()
Validates that the entered batch code follows the format XXXX-123:

XXXX must be 4 alphabetic characters.
123 must be 3 numeric digits.
If the batch code is valid, returns 1; otherwise, returns 0.
displayMessage()
Displays a message in color:

Color is specified using ANSI escape codes (e.g., green for success, red for error).
The message is reset to default after display.
displayStudent()
Displays the details of a student in a formatted table:

Shows the student's ID, Name, Batch Code, Class, and Faculty.
Error Handling
If the studentManagement.txt file cannot be opened, the system will print an error message and exit the operation.
If a student cannot be found during search, delete, or modify operations, the user will be notified that the student was not found.
Invalid batch codes will be rejected and the user will be prompted to enter a valid one.
Data Storage
The student data is stored in a file called studentManagement.txt.
The data is stored in binary format to ensure efficient reading and writing.
Each record is a structure of type Student, containing the student's ID, name, batch code, class, and faculty.

Conclusion
This Student Management System provides a simple and effective way to manage student records. It supports adding, deleting, modifying, and searching student details while ensuring proper validation and error handling. The data is stored persistently in a text file, allowing the system to retain records across program runs.

Feel free to modify the code and add features such as sorting, searching by name, or a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
