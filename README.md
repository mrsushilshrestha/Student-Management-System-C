# Student Management System

## Overview
The **Student Management System** is a simple console-based application implemented in **C** to manage student records. It allows users to perform basic operations such as **adding**, **deleting**, **modifying**, **searching**, and **displaying** student records. The records are stored in a text file named `studentManagement.txt`.

The application supports the following functionalities:
1. **Add a Student**: Add a new student with a unique ID and details (Name, Batch Code, Class, Faculty).
2. **Delete a Student**: Delete a student record using their batch code.
3. **Modify a Student**: Modify the details of an existing student by their batch code.
4. **Show Students**: Display a list of all students stored in the system.
5. **Search for a Student**: Search for a student based on their batch code.
6. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Features
- **Batch Code Validation**: Ensures that the batch code follows the correct format: `XXXX-123` (4 letters followed by a hyphen and 3 digits).
- **Dynamic ID Generation**: Automatically generates a unique student ID when adding a new student.
- **Color-coded Messages**: Success, error, and informational messages are displayed in color for better user experience.
- **File-Based Storage**: All student records are stored in `studentManagement.txt` and are persisted between program runs.

## Compilation and Execution

### Requirements:
- **C Compiler** (e.g., GCC).
- **Operating System** that supports C development.

### Steps to Compile and Run:
1. Save the code to a file named `student_management.c`.
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc -o student_management student_management.c



### Example User Interaction

Let's go through a typical session with the program:

#### **Adding a Student (Option 1)**

1. After selecting **1** to add a student, the program will generate a unique student ID for you.
2. Then, it prompts you to enter the student's details:
    ```
    Generated ID: 1
    Enter Name: John Doe
    Enter Batch Code (Format XXXX-123): ABCD-123
    Enter Class: Computer Science
    Enter Faculty: Engineering
    ```

3. Once the data is entered, the system confirms that the student was added successfully:
    ```
    Student added successfully!
    ```

4. The system will display the newly added student's details:
    ```
    ID   Name                           BatchCode Class      Faculty              
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1    John Doe                       ABCD-123  Computer Science  Engineering
    ```

#### **Deleting a Student (Option 2)**

1. Choose **2** to delete a student.
2. The program will ask for the **batch code** of the student to delete:
    ```
    Enter Batch Code to delete:
    ```

3. If the student is found, the system will confirm deletion with a message like this:
    ```
    Student deleted successfully!
    ```

4. If the batch code is incorrect, the system will notify the user:
    ```
    Student not found!
    ```

#### **Modifying a Student (Option 3)**

1. Choose **3** to modify a studentâ€™s details.
2. Enter the **batch code** of the student you want to modify:
    ```
    Enter Batch Code to modify:
    ```

3. After finding the student, you will be prompted to modify the student's details:
    ```
    Enter new Name: Jane Doe
    Enter new Batch Code (Format XXXX-123): XYZA-456
    Enter new Class: Software Engineering
    Enter new Faculty: Computer Science
    ```

4. Once modifications are done, the system will show the updated student details:
    ```
    Student modified successfully!
    ID   Name                           BatchCode Class               Faculty
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1    Jane Doe                       XYZA-456  Software Engineering  Computer Science
    ```

#### **Showing All Students (Option 4)**

1. When you select **4**, all student records are displayed:
    ```
    ID   Name                           BatchCode Class      Faculty              
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1    John Doe                       ABCD-123  Computer Science  Engineering
    2    Jane Doe                       XYZA-456  Software Engineering  Computer Science
    ```

#### **Searching for a Student (Option 5)**

1. Choose **5** to search for a student by their **batch code**.
2. The system will prompt for the **batch code**:
    ```
    Enter Batch Code to search:
    ```

3. If the student is found, the system displays their details:
    ```
    ID   Name                           BatchCode Class      Faculty              
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1    John Doe                       ABCD-123  Computer Science  Engineering
    ```

4. If no student is found, it will display:
    ```
    Student not found!
    ```

#### **Exiting the Program (Option 6)**

1. Choose **6** to exit the program:
    ```
    Exiting the system...
    ```
